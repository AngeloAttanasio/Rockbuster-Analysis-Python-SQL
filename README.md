# Rockbuster-Analysis-SQL

## Overview and Objective 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
I worked as a data analyst with Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. Firstly, I loaded the Rockbuster dataset into the PostgreSQL database. I then used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

## Key questions I answered
- What was the average rental duration?
- What was the average rental rate?
- Which movies contributed the most to revenue gains? Which ones contributed the least?
- Which are the most popular movie genres?
- Which are the countries that contributed more in terms of customer numbers?
- Which are the top 10 cities within the top countries in terms of customer numbers?
- Who are the top customers in terms of total amount paid?

## Tools 
- SQL for data analysis
- Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint for presentation
